# p5-hard-mode

This mode removes Processing Editor functionality to disable saving and loading of sketches. You have to start with a blank canvas. When you run the sketch, your code will be deleted. Syntax highlighting and error checking are disabled as well. Don't try copy/paste. Be in the moment!
